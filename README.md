# Internet Speed Test (IST)
#IST speed test gives you an estimate of your current Internet speed. You will generally be able to get this speed from leading Internet services, which use globally distributed servers.

- Why does #IST focus primarily on download speed?
 > Download speed is most relevant for people who are consuming content on the Internet, and we want #IST to be a very simple and fast speed test.

- What about ping, latency, upload and other things?
> When you click the “Show more info” button, you can see your upload speed and connection latency (ping). #IST provides two different latency measurements for your Internet connection: “unloaded” and “loaded” with traffic. The difference between these two measurements is also called “bufferbloat”.

- How are the results calculated?
> To calculate your Internet speed, #IST performs a series of downloads from and uploads to @AladaApp servers and calculates the maximum speed your Internet connection can provide. More details are in our blog post.

- Will the #IST speed test work everywhere in the world?
> #IST will test Internet speed globally on any device (phone, laptop, or smart TV with browser).

- Why is @AladaApp offering the #IST speed test?
> We want our members to have a simple, quick, ad-free way to estimate the Internet speed that their ISP is providing.

NOTE: ``If results from #IST and other internet speed tests often show less speed than you have paid for, you can ask your ISP about the results.``
